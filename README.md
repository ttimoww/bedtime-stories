# Create T3 App

This is a [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) project bootstrapped with `create-t3-app`.

## What's next? How do I make an app with this?

We try to keep this project as simple as possible, so you can start with just the scaffolding we set up for you, and add additional things later when they become necessary.

## Authentication Setup

This project uses Google OAuth for authentication. To set it up:

1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project or select an existing one
3. Enable the Google+ API
4. Go to "Credentials" and create an "OAuth 2.0 Client ID"
5. Set the authorized redirect URI to `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/google` for development
6. Copy the Client ID and Client Secret
7. Add them to your `.env` file:
   ```
   AUTH_GOOGLE_ID="your-client-id"
   AUTH_GOOGLE_SECRET="your-client-secret"
   ```

For production, make sure to update the redirect URI to your production domain.
