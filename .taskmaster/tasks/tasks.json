Design and implement UI components for theme selection within the story creation form. This could be a dropdown menu or a set of radio buttons allowing users to choose their desired theme.\n4. Ensure the UI components are styled consistently with the existing design system, using CSS or a UI library like Material-UI or Tailwind CSS.\n5. Update the story creation form to pass the selected theme to the story generation function when a new story is created.",
