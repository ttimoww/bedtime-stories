# Priority: high
# Description: Create a UI component to display generated stories with sections for title, content, moral lesson, and discussion questions, ensuring responsive design and readability.
# Details:
Develop a React component named `StoryDisplay` that will render the story title, content, moral lesson, and discussion questions. Use CSS Flexbox or Grid for layout to ensure responsive design across different screen sizes. Apply consistent typography using a library like Google Fonts for readability. Ensure the component is styled to be visually appealing, possibly using a design system or library like Material-UI or Tailwind CSS. Consider accessibility features such as ARIA roles and keyboard navigation. The component should be modular to allow easy updates or changes to the story format.

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify the component renders correctly with mock data for title, content, moral lesson, and discussion questions. 2. Test responsiveness by resizing the browser window and ensuring the layout adjusts appropriately. 3. Check typography for readability and consistency across different browsers. 4. Use accessibility tools to ensure the component is navigable via keyboard and screen readers. 5. Conduct user testing to gather feedback on visual appeal and readability.
