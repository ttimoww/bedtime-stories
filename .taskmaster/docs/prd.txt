# User Experience  
- **User Personas**
  - "Busy Parent" – Needs a fast, engaging way to read stories at bedtime.
  - "Curious Kid" – Loves hearing stories where they are the main character.
  
- **Key User Flows**
  - Flow 1: New user → Sign up → Enter child's name → Select story icon → Generate → Read
  - Flow 2: Returning user → Log in → Access saved stories or generate new one
  
- **UI/UX Considerations**
  - Simple, playful interface with large buttons and illustrations
  - Mobile-first design
  - Minimal steps to reach a story
  - Option to "regenerate" story if user wants a new variation

# Technical Architecture  
- **System Components**
  - **Frontend:** Built with Next.js using the create-t3-app boilerplate. Uses TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui for consistent, accessible component styling. tRPC is used for full-stack type safety and seamless API routing.
  - **Backend:** Application logic is encapsulated in tRPC routers within the Next.js app. Story generation is triggered via server-side functions that interact with the OpenAI API.
  - **Database:** PostgreSQL, accessed through Prisma ORM.
  - **Authentication:** NextAuth.js using email/password (credentials provider) or magic link/email-based login.
  - **Story Engine:** GPT-powered generation via OpenAI's API, with server-side logic to construct prompts and parse responses.

- **APIs and Integrations**
  - **tRPC Routers**: Handle all application logic for user sessions, child profiles, story creation, and story retrieval.
  - **OpenAI API**: Generates story content based on name and selected category.
  - **Prisma Client**: Handles all database interactions.
  - **NextAuth.js**: Manages session and authentication state across the app.

# Development Roadmap  
- **MVP Requirements**
  - Basic auth (email/password)
  - Name input for story personalization
  - Icon-based story category selection
  - Story generation (via API)
  - Save and retrieve generated stories

- **Future Enhancements**
  - Audio narration feature
  - Ability to tweak story details (e.g., setting, supporting characters)
  - Daily story suggestions / streaks
  - Multiple children profiles
  - Shareable story links
  - Offline access

# Logical Dependency Chain
- Step 1: User auth system and database schema
- Step 2: Frontend scaffolding with routing and basic UI
- Step 3: Build story generation interface (input + icon picker)
- Step 4: Integrate story generation API
- Step 5: Build display UI for generated story
- Step 6: Add save-to-library feature and story retrieval
- Step 7: Add polish — transitions, UX refinement, etc.

# Risks and Mitigations  
- **Technical challenges**
  - Prompt tuning and story quality → Start with 3–5 well-tested templates
- **Figuring out MVP that we can build upon**
  - Risk: Adding too many features early → Solution: Stick to 3 core flows
- **Resource constraints**
  - Risk: Over-scoping MVP → Mitigation: Only include essential UI and flows

# Appendix  
- **Research findings**
  - Kids respond better to stories that use their names and familiar themes
  - Parents prefer fewer steps and quick results at bedtime

- **Technical specifications**
  - Initial mobile target: Chrome + Safari browsers
  - Expected story length: 200–300 words
